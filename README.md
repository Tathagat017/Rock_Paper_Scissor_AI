Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors web application powered by TensorFlow.js and Google Teachable Machine. This interactive game allows users to play the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer opponent. What makes this game unique is its use of real-time hand movement detection from the webcam, enabling users to make selections using gestures.

## Features

- **Gesture-based Selection**: Utilizes TensorFlow.js and the Google Teachable Machine model to detect hand gestures in real-time, allowing users to choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissors by simply moving their hand.

- **Dynamic Computer Opponent**: The computer opponent randomly generates its selection after the user makes a choice. If the user changes their selection within 5 seconds, the computer also changes its choice accordingly.

- **Winner Declaration**: The game follows the standard rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors to declare a winner for each round and display the result on the screen.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application provides a clean and user-friendly interface for an enjoyable gaming experience.
