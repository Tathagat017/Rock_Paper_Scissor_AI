## Features

- **Gesture-based Selection**: Utilizes TensorFlow.js and the Google Teachable Machine model to detect hand gestures in real-time, allowing users to choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissors by simply moving their hand.

- **Dynamic Computer Opponent**: The computer opponent randomly generates its selection after the user makes a choice. If the user changes their selection within 5 seconds, the computer also changes its choice accordingly.

- **Winner Declaration**: The game follows the standard rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors to declare a winner for each round and display the result on the screen.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application provides a clean and user-friendly interface for an enjoyable gaming experience.
